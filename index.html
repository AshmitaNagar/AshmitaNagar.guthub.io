        <h2>Home</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the biography of Phoolan Prasad, a renowned Indian mathematician known for his contributions in the area on non-linear hyperbolic equations.Phoolan Prasad was born in a village Khejuri, District Ballia, UP and educated up to class 8 there.
            Then he studied in Nalhati HP High School, Krishnath College Berhampore, received his B.Sc. from the Presidency College, Calcutta University and M.Sc. from Rajabazar Science College campus of Calcutta University followed by a Ph.D. from Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore in 1968.</p>

        <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
        <p>He completed his undergraduate studies at Madras University and later pursued advanced studies in mathematics.Prasad started his career as a lecturer in the Department of Applied Mathematics in 1967 at Indian Institute of Science, thereafter he became a Professor in 1977. Meanwhile, he also remained a Postdoctoral Fellow at Leeds University (1970–72) and Alexander von Humboldt Fellow (1980-81). He was at the St John's College, Cambridge with privileges of a Fellow of the College. At IISc, he held Distinguished chair of MSIL Professorship during 1993-96, was Chairman of the Department of Mathematics during 1996-2000, was Professor in super-time-scale before his retirement on 31 July, 2006, was Honorary Professor during 2006-2011, was DAE Raja Ramanna Fellow also during 2006-2011, was INSA Senior Scientist in 2011, was NASI-Senior Scientist Platinum Jubilee Fellow during 2012 -2016
            Prasad has done some significant work in the area on non-linear hyperbolic equations. He succeeded in assessing the basic properties of the equations of various physical phenomena, generalized these mathematical properties and then used his theory to explain new results in the field of non-linear waves. He gave a proof of the existence of a new type of wave on the interface of a clear liquid and a mixture in a sedimentation process.</p>

            He has played in India an important role in the development of quality education in mathematics from school education to research.  He organized the training camps for International Mathematical Olympiad and worked for the Indian participation to IMO which became a reality since 1989. He was the leader of the Indian team at IMO, 1991 at Stockholm.</p>

        <h2>Awards and Books</h2>
        <p> He was awarded in 1983 the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, the highest science award in India, in the mathematical sciences category
            As a student of B.Sc. (Hons.) and M.Sc., he won many medals for proficiency in mathematics from Calcutta University during 1962 – 64 and was awarded National Merit Scholarship. 
            He has authored and edited many books such as,
              [Partial Differential Equations,A Mathematical Theory of Shock Propagation,Propagation of a curved shock and nonlinear ray theory,A Nonlinear Ray Theory, Nonlinear Hyperbolic Waves in Multidimensions.]</p>
